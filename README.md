# Wave-Simulation

This is a simple front-end application that simulates wave behavior using HTML canvas and JavaScript. Users can interact with different types of waves and particle shapes in the simulation.

## Features

- Start, pause, and reset the wave simulation.
- Select different types of waveforms: Longitudinal, Latitudinal, and Surface.
- Choose particle shapes: Box and Cycle.
- Adjust the speed of the simulation using a slider.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Upon opening the `index.html` file in your browser, you will see the simulation interface.
2. Use the "Start," "Pause," and "Reset" buttons to control the simulation.
3. Choose a wave type from the dropdown menu.
4. Select a particle shape from the dropdown menu.
5. Adjust the simulation speed using the speed slider.
